    "Consistency within one module or function is the most important.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> All style guides are fundamentally opinionated. **Some decisions genuinely do make code easier to use (especially matching indenting to programming structure), but many decisions are arbitrary**. The most important thing about a style guide is that it provides consistency, making code easier to write because you need to make fewer decisions.\n",
